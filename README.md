  "Garbage In - Garbage Out - Logocracy Oriented Language"
  
The politically correct programming language

It is widely known, that American history of slavery demands forbidding using words that can be considered related to slavery in any context, like information technology. "Master" used to be the senior practitioner of something who teaches his/her knowledge to the next generation, but because of American slavery the word is now evil, thus pretty much any computer system need be risked by retrospectively renaming the root directory of most software being used. This political correctness, or wokeness, naturally extends to gender, age, mental capacity, skin color or any differences. To stay safe from accidentally using evil words/symbols, all IT development need to be made woke-waterproof, GIGOLOL developed to fill the need of such a safe programming language.

Main concepts:

* Equality is implicit. Operators like "<", ">" are not legal, nor is "!=". The only needed equality operator is "=".
  As everything is equal, we need a new truth table for this operator (here with four bits):<br>

  This supports comparing variable contents, names or anything you like.

* As nothing should be an object, GIGOLOL is an "OD"-language, "Object Disoriented".

* Things are not black and white. Things should not be binary, thus quantum computing is highly recommended. If limited to pre-woke binary hardware, "bits" shall be called "nonbinary limbs", or "nols", that have the values:
  0 = "generally not considered true"
  1 = "it's widely known, that.."  

* Imperialistic or cultural structures like human languages are not supported, all structures need to be symbols not connected to specific ethnic or other cultures. Emojis or common programming symbols may be used, when not connected to such cultures. Note that Arrow symbols commonly used in programming symbology are clearly cultural appropriation of native American cultures and as such not allowed in any form.

* As results of all comparisons can be resolved at compile time, code performing (never use the word "execution") is exceptionally fast in GIGOLOL.
