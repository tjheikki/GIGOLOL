"Garbage In - Garbage Out - LOL"
The woke-compliant programming language

* Equality is granted. Operators like "<", ">" are not legal, nor is "!=". The only equality operator is "=". As we everything is equal, we need a new truth table for this operator:

This supports comparing variable contents, names or anything you like.

* Things are not black and white. Bits are redefined as:
** 0 = "generally not considered true"
** 1 = "it's widely known, that"
