# GIGOLOL
  "Garbage In - Garbage Out - LOL"
  
The woke-compliant programming language

* Equality is implicit. Operators like "<", ">" are not legal, nor is "!=". The only needed equality operator is "=".
  As everything is equal, we need a new truth table for this operator (here with four bits):<br>

  This supports comparing variable contents, names or anything you like.

* As nothing should be an object, GIGOLOL is an "OD"-language, "Object Disoriented".

* Things are not black and white. Things should not be binary, thus quantum computing is highly recommended. If limited to pre-woke binary hardware, "bits" shall be called "nonbinary limbs", or "nols", that have the values:
  0 = "generally not considered true"
  1 = "it's widely known, that.."  

* Imperialistic or cultural structures like human languages are not supported, all structures need to be symbols not connected to specific ethnic or other cultures. Emojis or common programming symbols may be used, when not connected to such cultures. Note that Arrow symbols obviously are cultural appropriation of native American cultures and as such not allowed.

* As results of all comparisons can be resolved at compile time, code performing (never use the word "execution") is exceptionally fast in GIGOLOL.
